                <p>ðŸŒŸ Executive Summary: National Disaster Management Information and Communication System (NDMICS)
This document presents the guidelines for establishing the 

National Disaster Management Information and Communication System (NDMICS), a comprehensive framework designed to shift Indiaâ€™s disaster management approach from reactive to proactive and holistic. Developed by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in February 2012, these guidelines outline a system that leverages technology to build a disaster-resilient society.



The NDMICS is built on two core components:


The National Disaster Management Information System (NDMIS): A GIS-based platform that provides crucial knowledge and decision-support tools.


The National Disaster Communication Network (NDCN): A reliable, multi-layered communication backbone for disseminating information to all stakeholders.

This system is designed to provide assured multi-services, including audio, video, and data, as well as valuable information for effective disaster management across all phases.

Key Highlights of the NDMICS
A Paradigm Shift in Disaster Management
The guidelines recognize that while natural disasters cannot be prevented, their impact can be minimized through proactive planning and the use of technology. The approach emphasizes assigning priority to 

prevention, mitigation, and preparedness activities, while also strengthening efforts for faster response and more effective recovery. This is in line with global initiatives such as the Tampere Convention, which India signed in 1999, highlighting the importance of telecommunication resources in saving lives and mitigating disasters.


The NDMICS addresses the specific ICT needs for each phase of the disaster continuum:


Mitigation & Recovery: These phases are less time-critical and require the transfer of large volumes of data for analysis, reconstruction, and documenting lessons learned. The Internet is well-suited for these activities.




Preparedness & Response: These are time-critical phases that demand rapid, reliable, and easily configurable communication for disseminating warnings and coordinating response teams.


National Disaster Management Information System (NDMIS)
The NDMIS is the intellectual core of the NDMICS, established on a 

GIS platform to provide knowledge-based information for decision-making. It integrates data from diverse sources, such as geographic, demographic, and hazard profiles, to create sophisticated tools:


Vulnerability Analysis and Risk Assessment (VA&RA): A tool for the pre-disaster phase used to predict the impact of a disaster, prioritize mitigation projects, and enforce building codes.


Decision Support System (DSS): An empowering tool for the during- and post-disaster phases that provides dynamic, real-time maps to guide rescue and relief operations, damage assessment, and recovery planning.



To ensure uninterrupted service, the NDMIS includes a 

Disaster Recovery (DR) site at the National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC), Hyderabad, which is geographically distant from the main National EOC (NEOC) in Delhi.

National Disaster Communication Network (NDCN)
The NDCN is envisioned as a "network of networks" that integrates existing telecommunication infrastructure like 

NICNET, SWANS, POLNET, and DMNET (ISRO). This network uses a terrestrial backbone (optical fiber/microwave) with a dedicated satellite-based backup to ensure fail-safe communication during disasters, which often disrupt terrestrial links.




A key focus of the NDCN is last-mile connectivity to the affected community and first responders, which is achieved in a graded manner:


Phase I: District authorities use a portable Mini Mobile Communication Pack (MMCP), consisting of satellite phones and VHF radios, to establish a basic communication link within 15 minutes of reaching a disaster site.



Phase II: NDRF battalions deploy a vehicle-based Mobile Emergency Operations Center (MEOC) with VSAT terminals, satellite phones, and VHF systems to provide enhanced voice, video, and data communication within three hours.



Phase III: Full communication is restored within two to seven days with the assistance of telecom service providers.

Implementation and Challenges
The successful implementation of NDMICS requires a planned, phased, and centrally managed approach. It is recommended as a turnkey project overseen by a qualified implementing agency for a period of five years to ensure quality and maintenance. The project will be centrally funded, with states responsible for civil and electrical infrastructure at their respective EOCs.




Key challenges identified in the document include:


Integration and Interoperability: Integrating disparate, standalone networks and ensuring seamless communication is a significant technical challenge.


Last-Mile Logistics: Ensuring the availability of power, fuel, and equipment, especially at disaster sites, is critical for network operation and maintenance.




Human Resource Development: Adequate training for operational, administrative, and technical staff is essential for the effective use of the system.


Language Barrier: The system must overcome linguistic barriers by providing multi-lingual call centers and websites for effective communication with a diverse population.</p>
